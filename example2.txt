AWS Organizations helps you centrally manage and govern your environment as you grow and scale your AWS resources. Using AWS Organizations, you can create accounts and allocate resources, group accounts to organize your workflows, apply policies for governance, and simplify billing by using a single payment method for all of your accounts. AWS Organizations is integrated with other AWS services so you can define central configurations, security mechanisms, audit requirements, and resource sharing across accounts in your organization. AWS Organizations is available to all AWS customers at no additional charge.
Manage your AWS accounts: AWS accounts are natural boundaries for security, costs, and workloads. We recommend using a multi-account approach to scale your cloud environment. Simplify account creation by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), SDKs, or APIs. You can centrally provision recommended resources and permissions to those accounts with AWS CloudFormation.
Secure and monitor your accounts: Provide tools and access for your security team to manage security for the organization. Provide read-only security access across accounts, detect and mitigate threats using Amazon GuardDuty, review access to resources using AWS IAM Access Analyzer, and secure data using Amazon Macie.
Control access and permissions: Set up AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) to provide access to AWS accounts and resources using your Active Directory, and customize permissions to match job roles. Apply service control policies (SCPs) to users, accounts, or OUs to control access to AWS resources, services, and Regions within your organization.
